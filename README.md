# TRAFFIC : A data-driven foundation for reparative justice
*A transparent “golden source” tracing the economic architecture of enslavement.*

---

## Elevator Pitch

This initiative constructs the first unified data model and ingestion platform for historical material related to transatlantic slavery. It consolidates shipping logs, estate ledgers, tax records, compensation data, and archival documents into an open, auditable “golden source.” Using modern AI and distributed contribution tools, the system builds a complete forensic chain of financial flows from capture to compensation. The result is a transparent foundation for researchers, policymakers, and descendant communities to examine slavery’s economic legacy with unprecedented clarity.

---

## Scope

This project focuses on documenting the slave trade and the economic and fiscal flows associated with it, together with the outputs of those held as slaves on plantations, in factories, and in households.

Slavery is a problem our societies still confront today.  
The scope of this project is **historical slavery**, understood as the legally sanctioned systems that created, taxed, regulated, and later officially abolished slavery—though often only in part.

The table and timelines below set out how slavery became acceptable, taxable, regulated, and eventually abolished.  
The **United States** still has the power to sentence a person convicted of a crime to slavery.

    title Scope of TRAFFIC pilot study

    1700-1780 : Atlantic World – Peak transatlantic volumes; British, French, Dutch at scale
    1780-1830 : Europe & Americas – Abolitionist movements grow; trade bans begin
    1807-1808 : UK & US – Trade abolition laws; illegal trade persists
    1830-1865 : Caribbean & US – Emancipation laws; compensation to owners, forced labour variants
    1865-1888 : US & Brazil – Final legal abolitions; rise of post-slavery systems

## Definition: TRAFFIC

For the purposes of this project, **TRAFFIC** refers to the organised movement, sale, transfer, or forced relocation of human beings for exploitation or financial gain.

The term includes:

- Capture or coercion of individuals  
- Forced transport by land or sea  
- Sale or transfer of people as property  
- Movement between plantations, estates, ships, or markets  
- Inter-colonial or intra-national relocation for labour  
- Ownership transfers through sale, inheritance, mortgage, or corporate control  
- State-sanctioned relocation (penal labour, military impressment, judicial orders)  
- Post-abolition systems that continued forced labour under new legal terms  

This definition aligns with international standards (UN Palermo Protocol, ILO, OHCHR) and with the historical legal frameworks of the UK, Europe, the United States, and Brazil.  
It is intentionally broad to allow accurate reconstruction of financial flows, ownership networks, and institutional responsibility across the entire transatlantic slavery system.

## Competitive Landscape

At present, **no** project provides a single, unified, public “source of truth” that reconstructs the complete financial architecture of slavery—from capture points through transport, ownership, labour, profit, taxation, and compensation.

Existing efforts are valuable but **fragmented**:

- **Slave Voyages Database** – Maritime-only; no financial trail.
- **UCL – Legacies of British Slave-ownership** – Strong ownership & compensation data; limited integration.
- **National Archives (Kew)** – Holds vast records; no unified schema or transparency.
- **Institutional acknowledgements** – Banks, insurers, churches; no forensic audits.
- **Academic research** – Rich but siloed; no integrated financial modelling.

**No existing initiative builds a financial chain of evidence across regions, institutions, and centuries.**

---

## Why This Project Is Different

### 1. A complete forensic trail  
End-to-end reconstruction of financial flows—from capture to compensation.

### 2. A transparent, public “golden source”  
Open, permanent, and designed for public scrutiny and contribution.

### 3. Modern ingestion capabilities  
Software already in place for remote submission by volunteers and record-keepers.

### 4. Data modelling suited to reparations  
A schema capable of supporting defensible quantum calculations.

### 5. Support for descendants  
A platform enabling accurate, evidence-based family and community history.

### 6. Integration across archives  
A system designed to link digital archives, national repositories, academic datasets, and contributed material.
